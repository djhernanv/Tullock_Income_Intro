        On the next screen you will have the opportunity to try the task five times. You will face sequences of various lengths to get a good impression of the task.
        To submit an answer, hit the <span class="badge badge-info"> ⏎ Enter</span> key.
        If your answer is correct, the next sequence is displayed. Otherwise, the same sequence is displayed again and you can submit another answer.
        The timer in blue above the input field will tell you how long you take for each sequence.
