        In the following rounds of counting letters you can earn money.
        <strong>For each sequence in which you count the correct number of "a"s </strong>
        you will receive <strong>{{ Constants.tokensper_string }} Token</strong> (Tk). That is your wage.
        At the end of this session, one Token will be converted into <strong>{{ Constants.eurosper_token }} Euro</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will start solving short sequences. After each sequence you solve, the <strong>length of the sequences will increase
        by {{ Constants.increase_per_string|apnumber }} characters</strong>. The sequences presented and their order are identical for all participants.
        Also, all participants have to count the same letter ( <strong>a</strong> ) such that <strong>everybody faces the same difficulty in solving the task</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        At any time, you have the option to change to the <strong><em>switch mode</em></strong>. In this mode, you will earn <strong>1 Token
        per {{ Constants.secondsper_token|apnumber }} seconds</strong> without solving any tasks. For instance, spending 13 seconds in the
        <strong><em>switch mode</em></strong> earns you 1.3 Tk. Since the difficulty of the task increases,
        at a certain point you will earn more from staying in the <em>switch mode</em>
        than from solving tasks. Think therefore about when it is best for you change to the <strong><em>switch mode.</em></strong>
        <p>
        <strong> Each round lasts {{ Constants.time_in_minutes|floatformat:0 }} minutes ({{ Constants.t }} seconds)</strong> in which you can either solve tasks or spend time in
        "switch" mode. A timer in yellow above the sequence will show you the time left in the current round and a green counter
        will tell you how many sequences you have solved so far.
    </p>

        <U>Important:</U> Once you are in the <strong><em>switch mode</em></strong> you cannot go back to the letter counting task!

        Below this panel you will find an example of how earnings from "Letter Counting" and "Switch" add up. During the first task an annotated tour will show you
        the new relevant elements (Page Timer, Counter of Solved Sequences, and Switch Button).
