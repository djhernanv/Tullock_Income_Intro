<div class="instructions well well-lg">
    <p>
        In the following series of sequences that each lasts {{ Constants.time_in_minutes|apnumber }} minutes you can earn money.
        <strong>For each sequence in which you count the correct number of "a"s </strong>
        you will receive <strong>{{ Constants.tokensper_string }} Token</strong> (Tk). That is your wage.
        At the end of this session, one Token will be converted into <strong>{{ Constants.eurosper_token }} Euro</strong>.
        Every participant has to count the same letter ( <strong>a</strong> ) in the same sequences of letters that are displayed in the same order such that
        <strong>everybody faces the same difficulty in counting the letters</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will start solving short sequences. After each sequence you solve, the <strong>length will increase
        by {{ Constants.increase_per_string|apnumber }} characters</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        At any time, you have the option to change to the <strong><em>switch mode</em></strong>. In this mode, you will earn <strong>1 Token
        per {{ Constants.secondsper_token|apnumber }} seconds</strong> without solving any tasks. For instance, spending 13 seconds in the
        <strong><em>switch mode</em></strong> earns you 1.3 Tk. Since the difficulty of the task increases,
        at a certain point you will earn more from staying in the <em>switch mode</em>
        than from solving tasks. Think therefore about when it is best for you change to the <strong><em>switch mode.</em></strong>

        <U>Important:</U> Once you are in the <strong><em>switch mode</em></strong> you cannot go back to the letter counting task!

        Below this panel you will find an annotated image with the positioning of the "switch" button. Make sure you have familiarized
        yourself with the screen before proceeding.
